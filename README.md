📌 Overview

This project is a Machine Learning mini-project that classifies SMS messages as either Spam or Ham (Not Spam).
It demonstrates text preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and deployment for a real-world NLP problem.

🚀 Features

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the SMS dataset.

🔤 Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization.

🧮 Feature Extraction: Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF.

🤖 Machine Learning Models: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

📈 Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.

🌐 Deployment: Streamlit (online demo available).

🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit

Deployment: Streamlit

📂 Dataset

Publicly available SMS Spam Collection dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository).

Contains ~5,500 labeled messages (spam or ham).

Example format:

label	message
ham	I'll call you later in the evening.
spam	Congratulations! You won a free ticket!
📝 Sample Messages for Testing
Spam Examples:
